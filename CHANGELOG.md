# Changelog

All notable changes to UniFetcher (called UniFetch before v0.1.2) are listed here, newest first. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v0.1.2 - 2026-10-23

### Renamed

- **UniFetch is now UniFetcher**, because the name UniFetch is already used by other projects. It installs as an update over UniFetch and keeps all your settings and history
- New downloads go to `Download/UniFetcher`. Files already in `Download/UniFetch` stay where they are

### Fixed

- After starting downloads, tapping Settings, Commands and other screens did nothing until the app was restarted
- The SD card folder switch wouldn't turn on after choosing a folder (it kept reopening the folder picker)
- If the SD card or USB drive was unavailable when a download finished, the downloaded file was deleted. Now it's saved to the phone instead and you're told
- Choosing an SD card or USB drive as the video folder now explains to use the "SD card or USB drive folder" option instead

### New

- **Share all tabs → UniFetch** now takes every link, not just the first (repeats are removed)
- The ⋮ menu above the download list works: stop all, resume stopped, retry failed, clear finished, clear failed/stopped
- **Storage guard:** with less than 2 GB free, new downloads wait instead of failing. A banner and notification explain why, and the queue carries on by itself once space is freed

## v0.1.1 - 2026-10-23

### Fixed

- UniFetch closed instantly when opened (v0.1.0). The app lock was reading settings before the app had finished starting up
- Added an automatic emulator test that opens every build, so this can't slip through again

## v0.1.0 - 2026-10-23

The first UniFetch release.

### Privacy basics (stage 3)

- App lock with a PIN or pattern, plus optional fingerprint. Choose how long UniFetch can be in the background before it locks again (immediately up to 15 minutes)
- Hide from recent apps and screenshots, on by default
- Discreet notifications: only "UniFetch" is shown, with no video titles or links, and nothing on the lock screen
- Quick wipe clears download history, cookies, browser data, cached thumbnails and cache. Downloaded files are kept
- UniFetch's data is never included in Google backups or phone-to-phone transfers
- All of these are under Settings → Privacy & security

### Automatic yt-dlp updates (stage 2)

- yt-dlp is checked for updates on every app launch, before fetching a video if the last check was over 6 hours ago, and in the background every 12 hours (on a network connection, battery not low)
- New settings: update automatically (default), ask me first, or off; channel Nightly (default), Stable or Master
- If a download fails because a site changed, UniFetch updates yt-dlp and retries once
- Settings show the yt-dlp version and when it was last checked, with a "Check now" button
- Roll back to the previous yt-dlp version if an update breaks things
- yt-dlp is never replaced while a download is running, and updates only come from the official yt-dlp GitHub releases

### Fork setup (stage 1)

- UniFetch is now its own app: new name, new app ID (`com.unifetch.app`, so it installs alongside Seal) and a new icon
- Credits Seal by JunkFood02 on the About and Credits screens and in the README
- Removed Seal's sponsor, donation, Telegram, Matrix and translation-site links
- App updates are now checked against UniFetch's own GitHub Releases
- New GitHub builds: a test APK on every push, and signed release APKs when a version tag is pushed
- Added the beginner guide HOW_TO.md

---
